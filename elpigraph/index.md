# ElPiGraph

ElPiGraph (Elastic Principal Graph) is a method for approximating datasets with complex topologies.

This directory contains codes, example datasets, and analyses centered on the application of ElPiGraph to different types of data.

## ElPiGraph implementations (from most to least complete)

[ElPiGraph.R](https://github.com/sysbio-curie/ElPiGraph.R) - implementation of ElPiGraph in R (most complete functionality and multi-core support)

[ElPiGraph.P](https://github.com/j-bac/elpigraph-python) - implementation of ElPiGraph in Python (Equivalent to R version, multi-core and GPU support. Missing some of the plotting functionalities)

[ElPiGraph.M](https://github.com/sysbio-curie/ElPiGraph.M) - implementation of ElPiGraph in MATLAB (Less options than Python and R version)

[ElPiGraph.Java](https://github.com/auranic/VDAOEngine/) - implementation of ElPiGraph as part of the VDAO engine

[ElPiGraph.Scala](https://github.com/mraad/elastic-graph) - implementation of ElPiGraph in Scala
