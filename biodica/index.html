              <p class="lead"><a href="https://github.com/LabBandSB/BIODICA">BIODICA</a> is a computational environment designed for the application
              of Independent Component Analysis (ICA) to large omics data sets and interpreting the results in a user-friendly manner. It provides a rich set
              of tools to visualize the results, interpret them using prior knowledge and sample annotations, and perform meta-analyses with several data sets.
              It comes with the python package <a href="https://stabilized-ica.readthedocs.io/en/latest/">stabilized-ica</a> which provides several ICA algorithms,
              a stabilization procedure to extract reliable and reproducible components, as well as python implementations of several analysis tools proposed by BIODICA.
              BIODICA is also equipped with a user-friendly graphical user interface allowing non-experienced users to perform the ICA-based analysis on their own transcriptomic data sets.

            <p>stabilized-ica is the computational core of BIODICA. It can also work as a standalone python tool, facilitating the integration of the ICA-based analysis into
            complex python pipelines which deal with transcriptomic data. It is available on <a href="https://pypi.org/project/stabilized-ica/">PyPI</a> and <a href="https://github.com/ncaptier/stabilized-ica">GitHub</a>.

            BIODICA Navigator is the graphical user interface of BIODICA. It allows the users to run BIODICA analyses without using command-line commands. It also provides
            the results in interactive ways, facilitating communication with biology experts.
